CS50 FINAL PROJECT - MINERALS by Toni Abril - December 2020


About MINERALS:

This web application is aimed at those people who have a collection of minerals,
or are doing so or for those people who work with minerals.
This website allows them to have all the minerals and their properties
in an organized way in the same database.


How it works:

"/register"
First of all you have to register in and once this is done you will have a table
linked with your user with 38 different minerals and its properties.

"/login"
Enter your credentials used when registring

"/root"
If you want to identify a specific mineral you will use the left bar as a filter,
where you could select up to 21 different properties of the minerals.
When you select a property, the web will only show the minerals that meet the selection and therefore,
with each selection, the characteristics that are shown will be reduced.

Also in the main page you can click on the minerals and it will show to you all its main
characteristics classified by optical properties, mechanical properties and other properties.
On optical properties you can see the color, the luster or the crystal system.
On mechanical properties you can see the Mohs hardness or the specific gravity among other properties.
Finally on the other properties you will find if the quoted mineral have induced magnetism,
or if it have a peculiar smell, for example. In the end of this sheet you will find a link
which will bring you to google where you could check for pictures of this mineral if you want to see them.

"/quote"
You can quote a mineral by its name in the quote section
and here, again, you can see all of its main characteristics.

"/add"
You can add a new mineral, because in this database there are only 38 minerals and in the planet Earth there are about 4000.
So it will be your job to improve the database.
It's very simple to add a new mineral, first of all write the name, click on save and fill the optical properties,
click on save, fill the mechanical properties and finally feel free to fill other properties as well before
clicking on save again.

"/modify"
Depending on which property you want to modify, the box will let you enter text or a number.
You have to select a mineral name, then the property you want to modify, type the modification
in the box below and click on save.

"/delete"
Choose the mineral to delete and click on save. The mineral will be deleted from your database.
